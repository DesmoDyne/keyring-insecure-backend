      # NOTE: these two jobs don't agree on where the package is built:
      #  + `uv build` out of the box builds package in .../code/python/dist
      #  + `gh-action-pypi-publish` action fails with error message
      #       No such file or directory: '/github/workspace/dist'
      #    so ostensibly, expects package there
      #  + attempting to adapt `uv build` to action fails with
      #      failed to create directory `/github/workspace/dist`:
      #        Permission denied
      # --> enforce corporate convention `.../tmp/artifacts` unto both:
      #  1. in `uv build` call, add `--out-dir`:
      #       https://docs.astral.sh/uv/reference/cli/#uv-build--out-dir
      #  2. in `gh-action-pypi-publish` action, configure `packages-dir`:
      #       https://github.com/marketplace/actions/pypi-publish ...
      #        ... #customizing-target-package-dists-directory
      #     --> unfortunately, `pypi-publish` docs are as sloppy as pretty much
      #         anything around PyPI (or python packaging as a whole):
      #         is `custom-dir/` absolute ? or relative ? (if so, to what ?)
